To check uf is a palindrome:
  If the string.lenght() = 1
     its a palindrome
  if the string.length() = 2
     are the characters the same?

  if length > 2:
     are the outside charcters the same, and then is "the middle" a palindrome
     * RECURSION FLAVOR*

Stage 1:
  make a 2d table (all length substring values, then booleans), determining if a  string is a palindrome
Stage 2:
  try to get the number of cuts
Stage 3:
  "if you can get the number, then yuo very likely have code that can efficiently insert | into the appropriate places."
