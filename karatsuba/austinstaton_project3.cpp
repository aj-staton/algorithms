Project 3 for CSCE350 multiplies large numbers (numbers that
struggle to fit in an integer, long, or other type). I will do
this by breaking down the large number into thier own elements
in a vector.

Example: 2,334,345,532,389 * 89,794,289,298,000

This file will solve this problem in two ways:
 1) Brute force. This is the highly intuitive
    approach that many people learn in grade school.
    	1234
       *  21
	1234     This algorithm takes n^2 time.
     + 24680
       25914
 2) The Karatsube Algorithm. This algorithm is much more
    efficient, taking n^~1.58 time.
