# CSCE350 Project 3
The third project for the Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms at the University of South Carolina--Columbia. This was taught by Dr. Jason O'Kane in the Fall of 2019.

## Multiplying Really Big Numbers
Your favorite variable type might not store a number big enough to represent the product of two numbers. A normal, signed, four-byte integer has limits of 01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 = 2,147,483,647. How do we multiply numbers larger? Use the 'long' datatype? What happens when its physical limits are reached? 
This program multiplies these massive numbers. There are two algorithms used:
* A brute-force multiplication algorithm (you might have learned this in the 4th grade)
* The Karatsuba algorithm.
